Language Model Analysis with DistilBERT
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the DistilBERT language model, examining its capabilities, limitations, biases, and practical applications through a series of experiments.

Project Overview
The language model analysis explores various aspects of DistilBERT's performance, including its understanding of context, bias patterns, sentiment analysis capabilities, and text generation potential. The project includes multiple experiments with visualizations to demonstrate the model's strengths and weaknesses.

Features
Basic Functionality: Tests fill-mask capabilities with various sentence structures

Contextual Understanding: Examines how the model handles polysemy (words with multiple meanings)

Bias Analysis: Investigates gender associations with different professions

Sentiment Analysis: Evaluates sentiment classification with attention visualization

Text Generation: Demonstrates text completion capabilities

Visualizations: Creates graphical representations of model behavior and biases

Requirements
Python 3.7+

transformers

torch

datasets

matplotlib

seaborn

numpy

pandas

Install dependencies with:

bash
pip install transformers torch datasets matplotlib seaborn numpy pandas
Model Information
This project uses DistilBERT (distilbert-base-uncased), a smaller, faster, cheaper version of BERT that retains 97% of its performance while being 40% smaller and 60% faster.

Experiments
1. Basic Fill-Mask Functionality
Tests the model's ability to predict masked words in simple sentences with multiple choice options.

2. Contextual Understanding
Examines how the model handles words with multiple meanings based on different contexts.

3. Bias Analysis
Investigates gender associations with various professions through probability scoring.

4. Sentiment Analysis with Attention Visualization
Uses a fine-tuned sentiment analysis model to classify text sentiment and visualize attention patterns.

5. Text Generation with Sampling
Demonstrates text completion capabilities using temperature sampling.

Usage
Run the script:

bash
python language_model_analysis.py
The script will:

Load the DistilBERT model and tokenizer

Perform all five experiments

Generate visualizations of results

Provide conclusions and insights about the model

Output Files
gender_bias_analysis.png: Visualization of gender associations with professions

attention_*.png: Attention weight visualizations for different sentences

Key Findings
Capabilities
Strong performance on fill-mask tasks with grammatical understanding

Effective handling of polysemy based on context

Reasonable sentiment analysis performance

Limitations and Biases
Exhibits gender biases in profession associations

Generated text can be inconsistent

Lacks true understanding of content

Practical Applications
Text completion in writing assistants

Sentiment analysis for customer feedback

Base for specialized NLP applications through fine-tuning

Ethical Considerations
The analysis highlights important ethical considerations:

Bias mitigation techniques are necessary before deployment

Users should be aware of model limitations

Output monitoring is essential for potentially harmful content

Customization
You can modify the script to:

Test different language models

Add new evaluation metrics

Expand bias analysis to other dimensions (racial, cultural, etc.)

Incorporate additional NLP tasks

Adjust generation parameters
